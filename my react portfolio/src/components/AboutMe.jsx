        <img src="assets/natimage.jpg" alt="Natalie Gindraux" />
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
        <p> I’m a passionate and results-driven Senior Product Manager with over 6 years of experience leading cross-functional teams and delivering innovative, customer-centric solutions. My diverse background combines expertise in product management, full-stack web development, and operations.

            I hold a Master’s degree in Project Management and Operations which equips me with a strong analytical mindset and a process-driven approach to solving complex business challenges.

            Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of working on a variety of products, including:
                <ul>
                <li>B2B SaaS solutions for business and industry.</li>
                <li>Chatbot platforms to enhance customer engagement.</li>
                <li>User-facing Android applications tailored to consumer needs.</li>
                <li>AI/ML-integrated platform products for actionable insights.</li>
                </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I thrive at the intersection of technology, design, and business, bridging the gap between technical teams and stakeholders. My approach is grounded in data-driven decision-making, and I excel at influencing without authority and fostering collaboration across teams.

            Whether I’m creating a roadmap for a new product, optimizing workflows, or leading strategic initiatives, I’m passionate about building impactful products that solve real-world problems and create value for users.
